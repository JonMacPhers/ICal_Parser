Hey there, so I've completed everything I believe.

*Command Line Arguments*
------------------------
My program takes user input database connection usernames as a
command line argument. Just type it at the end of the program 
execution.

------------------------
I think everything is good in terms of usability and what not?

*Store All Events*
My program does this correctly. Just load in my demo file.

*Store Current Event*
My program does this correctly. Just load in my demo file
and select an event by clicking it in the file panel.
If no event is selected, my program will automatically 
perform operations on the first event.

*Clear all Data*
My program successfully clears the database with this.

*Display DB*
My program displays the number of table entries in
regards to each table correctly in the log.

*Execute Query*
My program successfully does all these things I believe.


THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING THIS SEMESTER! :D
